# DataStructures
Implementation of common Data structures using C, C++ and Python.

# Purpose

To collect many important data structures for usage in go programs. I have implemented data-structure's as I have needed them. If there is a missing structure or even just a missing (or incorrect) method open an issue, send a pull request, or send an email patch.

I hope you find my library useful. If you are using it drop me a line I would love to hear about it. Also, many more data structures to be added to this repo.
