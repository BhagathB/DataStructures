    "Using brute force approach we get O(n^2) time complexity in worst case, which is not a good approach for this problem. So, a better data structure would yield better result. As the key concept involves in lookup. Binary tree will take O(log n) time to look up for an element. Hash table or array will take O(1) to lookup.\n",
