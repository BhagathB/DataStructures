    "A tree is a data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges without having any cycle. The tree with no nodes is called the null or empty tree. A tree that is not empty consists of a root node and potentially many levels of additional nodes that form a hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Properties: \n",
    "    - Root : The top node in a tree.\n",
    "    - Child : A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.\n",
    "    - Parent : The converse notion of a child.\n",
    "    - Siblings : A group of nodes with the same parent.\n",
    "    - Descendant : A node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child.\n",
    "    - Ancestor : A node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.\n",
    "    - Leaf : A node with no children.\n",
    "    - Branch : Connects two nodes.\n",
    "    - Internal node : A node with at least one child.\n",
    "    - Degree : The number of sub trees of a node.\n",
    "    - Edge : The connection between one node and another.\n",
    "    - Path : A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.\n",
    "    - Level : The level of a node is defined by 1 + (the number of connections between the node and the root).\n",
    "    - Height of node : The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path between that node and a leaf.\n",
    "    - Height of tree : The height of a tree is the height of its root node.\n",
    "    - Depth : The depth of a node is the number of edges from the tree's root node to the node.\n",
    "    - Forest : A forest is a set of n â‰¥ 0 disjoint trees.\n",
